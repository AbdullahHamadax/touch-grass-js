# Touch Grass

I think we all need to touch grass at least ONCE in our life, so I decided to make this as my first ever JS mini project.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahHamadax/touch-grass-js
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd touch-grass-js
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project locally.

## Usage

- Press the **Touch** button to increase the counter.
- Press the **Save** button to save your current score and view previous scores.
- The app will reset the score after saving.

## Demo

You can also view a live demo of the project hosted on [Vercel](https://touch-grass-js.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the page with utility-first CSS.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity (touch counter, save functionality).
